# MariaDB MaxScale 6.0.0 Release Notes

The versioning scheme has changed; the major number will now change at
every release which is not only a maintenance release. According to the
old scheme, the version number would have been 2.6.

Release 6.0 is a Beta release.

This document describes the changes in release 6, when compared to
release 2.5.

For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report on [our Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org/projects/MXS).

## Changed Features

### Columnstore monitor

The Columnstore monitor that in this release only supports Columnstore
version 1.5, is now capable of adjusting itself automatically to any
changes in the the cluster. In the configuration it is only specified
a node using which the monitor get in contact with the cluster, but
after that the monitor autonomously figures out the cluster configuration
and automatically adapts to any changes in the configuration. For more
details, please consult the
[monitor](../Monitors/ColumnStore-Monitor.md)
documentation.

## Dropped Features

## Deprecated Features

### Database Firewall filter

The filter is deprecated in MaxScale 6 and will be removed in MaxScale 7.

## New Features

### `nosqlprotocol` protocol module

This module implements a subset of the MongoDBÂ® wire protocol and
transparently converts MongoDB commands into the equivalent SQL
statements that subsequently are executed on a MariaDB server. This
allows client applications utilizing some MongoDB client library to
use a MariaDB server as backend. As the conversion is performed in
the protocol module, this functionality can be used together with
all MaxScale routers and filters. Please see the `nosqlprotocol`
[documentation](../Protocols/NoSQL.md) for more information.

### Defaults can be specified for `maxctrl`

If the file `~/.maxctrl.cnf` exists, maxctrl will use any values
in the section `[maxctrl]` as defaults for command line arguments.
Please see the `maxctrl` [documentation](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md)
for details.
