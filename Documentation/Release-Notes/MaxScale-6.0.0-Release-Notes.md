# MariaDB MaxScale 6.0 Release Notes

Release 6.0 is a Beta release.

This document describes the changes in release 6, when compared to
release 2.5.

For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report at [Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org).

## Changed Features

## Dropped Features

## Deprecated Features

### Database Firewall filter

The filter is deprecated in MaxScale 6 and will be removed in MaxScale 7.

## New Features

### `nosqlprotocol` protocol module

This module implements a subset of the MongoDBÂ® wire protocol and
transparently converts MongoDB commands into the equivalent SQL
statements that subsequently are executed on a MariaDB server. This
allows client applications utilizing some MongoDB client library to
use a MariaDB server as backend. As the conversion is performed in
the protocol module, this functionality can be used together with
all MaxScale routers and filters. Please see the `nosqlprotocol`
[documentation](../Protocols/NoSQL.md) for more information.
